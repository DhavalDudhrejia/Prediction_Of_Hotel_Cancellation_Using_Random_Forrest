# Prediction_Of_Hotel_Cancellation_Using_Random_Forrest
Here I have used Random forest to classify and predict the hotel room cancellation

Project Description:
In this particular project, we are using the Hotel_Booking dataset that contains information like hotel, meal, country, meal, adult, children deposit type etc and using that to predict the chances of cancellation.
However, before you go ahead and make predictions, it is advised that you first pre-process and study the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
Data Details:
All the column names are self explanatory
